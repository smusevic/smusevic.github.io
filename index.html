He is very fast and wriggly but we think this is just his “wild nature”.  He has settled in with the rest of the gecko clan very well.</p> -->

						<h2>Our Care Commitment</h2>
						<p>Since we opened our doors in 2014, our aim at Zoo Education C.I.C (Zoo-Ed) has been to provide children with unique, quality animal inspired learning experiences.</p><br/>
						<p>At Zoo-Ed we cherish the special relationships we have with the animals in our care and believe that every child should have the opportunity to explore the human-animal bond.  This unique bond is widely viewed as a support system which parallels the infant-parent relationship and can help us cope with emotional stress.</p><br/>
						<p>Animals are our world and as such we strive to provide our animals with the healthiest, safest and most  nurturing environment that we possibly can.  All our animals are kept at home and are very much part of the family. </p><br/>
						<p>Zoo-Ed are fiercely opposed to the cruelty of the international pet-trade and as part of our on-going commitment to animals, we ensure that the animals who come into our care are either sourced from responsible, local breeders or are rescued.</p><br/>
						<!-- <p>Our rescue animals are usually victims of circumstance and with gentle rehabilitation we are often able to take these animals out into schools and the wider community.  However, some animals are not suitable for schools and are available for supported re-homing.  All considered homes are vetted and supported by our in-house veterinary bio-scientist Heather Russell.</p><br/> -->
						<p>We believe that the mission of providing quality animal care should be a never-ending process of policy and review. Therefore, we constantly review our policies and procedures to provide the best possible care for our animals.</p><br/>
						<p>Our most recent policy under development was 'The Rule of Four'.  This policy details that our animals will:							
						</p><br/>
						<ol>
							<li>Work for a <em>maximum</em> of 4 hours per day.</li>
							<li><em>Never</em> experience travel time of more than 4 hours (2 hours each leg of the journey).</li>
							<li>Work a <em>maximum</em> of 4 days per week.</li>
							<li>Enjoy 4 <em>consecutive</em> days off each week.</li>

								<h3>Education Visits</h3>
								<p>We will work to what best suits busy teaching timetables.  For schools we usually suggest a one and half hour visit (i.e. 10.30 – 12pm/1.15 – 2.45pm) as this allows time for all the children to interact with the animals (i.e. petting/feeding), investigate their habitat and write up any findings.</p>
								<p>We understand that nurseries enjoy a freer learning community and suggest a forty minutes - one hour session for the younger children. All our school visits are underpinned by the Curriculum for Excellence (ACfE) and for younger children pre-birth to three.</p>
								<p>Our education visits are carried out by Fiona McCrindle (Bed HONS) who is a fully qualified and registered teacher and as such there is no requirement for the class teacher to stay during the visit.</p>

									<p>Our entertaining and action packed parties are great for any special occasion that you might be organising. They are filled with amazing animal jokes, games and fast, fun animals facts. These parties are always a hit with the children and adults and they will be raving about them for months afterwards.</p>

Our party girl Heather then moves onto 20 minutes of animal party games (prizes included).  The games are then followed up by a balloon modelling session OR an animal face painting session and finally an additional handling session for all the budding David Attenborough's out there!</p>
									<h2><i><a>2hr - &pound;155</a></i></h2>
									<h3><a>Toddler Parties</a> </h3>
