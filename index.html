						<h2>A Little Bit About Us</h2>
<p>Zoo-Ed was an idea born out of passion for both animals and education. We believe that the best way to learn about the animal kingdom is to experience handling the animals for yourselves.</p>
<p>One of our main aims at Zoo-Ed is to rescue and rehabilitate abandoned animals. Between us we have around 30 years rescuing and rehabilitating abandoned animals and have built a wealth of knowledge of all things animal related.</p>
<p>We also travel to schools, nurseries and community events, treating you to a truly unique handling experience.  We guarantee you will be enthralled by our beautiful animals and it won't take long before you fall in love with our gorgeous wee hedgehog Pippa!</p>

								<h3>Poppy and Lily the Domestic Rats</h3>
								<p>Poppy and Lily are two sisters that were found inside an old rat cage that we picked up for use at Zoo-Ed. We reckon they are just under 1 year old and haven't been handled regularly as they are very timid, scared of being handled and run away at any opportunity. They are currently being rehabilitated at Heathers and are coming on very well. They are starting to enjoy being handled and enjoy sitting on Heather's lap whilst she is working or watching television. In a couple of months these girls are going to be fabby.</p>

								<h3>Bonnie the Domestic Rat</h3>
								<p>Bonnie came to Zoo-Ed with her sister Georgie after being rescued from their previous owner's. They both had respiratory problems and received regular medication from the vets. Unfortunately Georgie did not make it and Bonnie was lucky and pulled through. She lives with Molly who mothers her at every opportunity. She is a very affectionate rat and loves nothing more than curling up in your pocket or hood and falling asleep. A generally lovely, caring rat.</p>

								<h3>Pippa the Pygemy Hedgehog</h3>
								<p>We were given Pippa when her owner could no longer look after her. Pippa was very shy and very dirty when she arrived but thanks to Heather she is slowly coming round after a warm oatmeal bath and lots of TLC. She thoroughly enjoys human contact now and is always great with the kids during our school visits.

								<h3>Seamus the Rabbit</h3>
								<p>Seamus is around 2 years old and is doing really well since coming into our care after his owners sadly moved abroad. He was quite nervous when he arrived; always checking out the escape routes, but is settling down now and is possibly the sweetest rabbit we've ever met. He is a very gentle rabbit who loves nothing more than sitting around and getting cuddles.</p>

								<p>Wee Phillip is an absolute star! He is around 1 year old now and came to us when his owner's guinea pig produced a surprise litter of babies, him being one of them. This little piggy demands plenty of love and affection. Oh yeah, and food is pretty high on his agenda to! You can always hear Phillip before you see him. As soon as one of the crew opens up, he is squeaking for his breakfast.</p>

								<h3>Albert The Bearded Dragon</h3>
								<p>Our Albert is just gorgeous inside and out. Albert was cruelly abandoned outside a local pet shop in the east end of the city. Thankfully the shop owner found him relatively quick as he wouldn't have survived long without heat and give us a call. He is such a friendly boy and we are shocked at who would've abandoned this once much loved pet. Albert loves his food, particularly his worms and additionally he loves coming out and falling asleep on our laps.</p>

								<p>Molly is our very own reptile specialist David's pet rat. She is over 2 and a half years now and is a big sook, especially with David. She is the boss of the rat house and keeps all the other girls in check, mothering them when need be. Molly loves being handled and is especially good with the children out on visits.</p>

								<h3>Betty the Boa Constrictor</h3>
								<p>Betty was given to us as her owner became scared of her as she was not handled enough as a young snake and became quite strikey out of fear. David has been working with her for a couple of months now and she becomes friendlier every day. She enjoys coming out and slithering around. On the neck she becomes very settled and enjoys being stroked. She is a lovely snake and we can only predict that she will become better with time.</p>

								<h3>Bobby the Boa Constrictor</h3>
								<p>Bobby was given to us as his owner felt he was becoming too big and didn't have the space for him. Bobby settled in straight away after regular handling and some TLC. Like Betty, he enjoys slithering about and on a warm day loves to go outside and slither through the grass. Maybe he thinks he is on the hunt. He has a great appetite and sheds his skin very well. He is such a beautifully coloured and beautifully natured snake</p>

								<h3>Malky the Bearded Dragon</h3>
								<p>Malky belongs to David and has been with him for nearly 2 years now. He is a very active and curious lizard that loves getting out his vivarium and walking around the office.  We think he has ants in his pants because he is forever on the go! He is very affectionate as well and loves to climb up onto your shoulder and have a look at what's going on.</p>

They enjoy having a climb and investigating new places. Helen is the boss of the gecko plan and bosses the boys about. She has a great nature and great with all the kids.</p>

								<h3>Gordon the Leopard Gecko</h3>
								<p>Gordon was brought to us as he was a hitchhiker that came across from India in a suitcase. As a result he is not domesticated and was obviously never handled.  Fortunately he was a baby so it was easy for us to handle him from a young age and he has grown up to be a lovely natured gecko. He is very fast and wriggly but we think this is just his “wild nature”.  He has settled in with the rest of the gecko clan very well.</p>

Think dogs, cats, rabbits, tortoises, canaries and many more. She has had many pets throughout her childhood and knew from early on that she wanted to have a career working with animals.</p>
									<p>Fiona started out doing a Veterinary Nursing degree, worked in catteries and kennels, veterinary practices and spent her weekends at the riding stables. After some travel she then decided to go into teaching and qualified as a primary school teacher in 2008.</p>
									<p>After spending a few years travelling and teaching, Fiona co-founded Zoo-Ed with her partners Heather and Davie. For Fiona, Zoo-Ed has been the perfect marriage incorporating her love for both animals and teaching.</p>

									<h3>Heather Russell:</br>Veterinary Bio Scientist</h3>
									<p>Heather grew up in a small town surrounded by countryside and spent her childhood around animals. From the age of 10-17 she owned horses, worked in a veterinary practice and spent her summers volunteering around the local farms helping out with lambing, milking and general farm work.</p>
									<p>She then went to Glasgow University and completed a degree in Veterinary Bioscience which is an animal research degree. Some aspects of the course included animal health, animal welfare, animal management, animal handling and much much more.</p>
									<p>Known at Zoo-Ed as the "rat whisperer", Heather's favourite animals are rats and she is always fostering our girls at her home to provide them with lots of cuddles. It's safe to say the girls come back very spoiled after a few weeks at auntie Heathers!</p>

						<div class="col-md-6">
							<div class="service-grid text-center">
								<h3>Education Visits</h3>
								<p>We will work to what best suits busy teaching timetables.  For schools we usually suggest a one and half hour visit (i.e. 10.30 – 12pm/1.15 – 2.45pm) as this allows time for all the children to interact with the animals (i.e. petting/feeding), investigate their habitat and write up any findings.</p>
								<p>We understand that nurseries enjoy a freer learning community and suggest a forty minutes - one hour session for the younger children. All our school visits are underpinned by the Curriculum for Excellence (ACfE) and for younger children pre-birth to three.</p>
								<p>Our education visits are carried out by Fiona McCrindle (Bed HONS) who is a fully qualified and registered teacher and as such there is no requirement for the class teacher to stay during the visit.</p>

								<h3>Animal Therapy</h3>
								<p>The therapeutic benefits of animal handling are well documented and we at Zoo-Ed are lucky enough to be able to offer this service.</p>
								<p>We regularly attend nursing homes, supported living centre's, hospices, hospitals, schools for the visually impaired and other special need units.</p>
								<p>Depending on the number and needs of the individuals we usually recommend a one – one and a half hour visit.</p>

								<h3>Special Occasions</h3>

								<h3>Comunity Events</h3>
								<p>Our two hour petting zoo events are a great way to enhance your profile within the local community. We give everyone the chance to handle the animals and our experienced animal handler will also present fun, friendly and interactive demonstrations. We will talk about their species, habitats, diets, and life spans and for younger children we will focus more on movements and sounds, always making sure that the children can see the animals in action.</p>

									<h3><a>Animal Therapy</a></h3>
									<p>The therapeutic benefits of animal handling are well documented and we at Zoo-Ed are lucky enough to offer this service. We regularly attend nursing homes, supported learning centres, hospices and schools for the visually impaired and other special needs units. Depending on the number and needs of the individuals, we usually recommend a 1 to 1.5 hour session.</p>

									<h3><a>Educational Visits</a></h3>

									<p>At Zoo-Ed we understand the diversity between each school and nursery and therefore have published this price list as a guide. We also understand the demands of busy teaching timetables and are happy to work around these time constraints so if you need more or less time, just ask!</p>
